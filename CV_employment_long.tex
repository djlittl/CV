\begin{minipage}{\minipagewidth}
\textbf{Principal Member of the Technical Staff}, Sandia National Laboratories (Jan.~2014 - Present)
\vspace{0.06in}

I perform research in the formulation, implementation, and application of multiscale, multiphysics modeling techniques for computational solid mechanics.
\vspace{0.06in}

(1)~~Principal Investigator for the ASC-ATDM/ECP Multiscale Technology Demonstrator project.  The goal of this project is to drive development of emerging technologies for the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) and the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Advanced Technology Development and Mitigation (ATDM) program.  Key elements include the \emph{Kokkos} package for performance portability across disparate hardware architectures and the \emph{DARMA} asynchronous many-task scheduler.

%(1)~~Principal Investigator of the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project ``Strong Local-Nonlocal Coupling for Integrated Fracture Modeling.''  The goal of this project is development of a mathematically consistent formulation of local-nonlocal coupling that allows for full integration of peridynamics with classical finite element analysis.  An open-source, collaborative software framework provides a proving ground for candidate approaches. Deployment to the laboratory will occur through the \emph{Sierra/SolidMechanics} production code.
%\vspace{0.06in}

(2)~~Serving as a lead developer for the open-source peridynamics code \emph{Peridigm}.  This work employs Sandia's \emph{Trilinos} software suite, including the \emph{Sacado} automatic-differentiation package for construction of the tangent matrix for implicit time integration.  Current applications include the modeling of ductile material failure and simulation of material fracture under blast loading conditions.
\vspace{0.06in}

(3)~~Developing a crystal plasticity constitutive model suitable for multiscale, multiphysics modeling within the \emph{Albany/LCM} simulation code.  Multiphysics modeling will capture the effect of hydrogen embrittlement.  A concurrent, Schwarz-based coupling scheme will allow the linking of an explicitly-modeled grain structure at the mesoscale with a continuum plasticity model at the component scale.

\textbf{Research Associate}, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Jun.~2006 - Oct.~2008) \\ 
%
Completed research in the area of computational mechanics in collaboration with Professor Antoinette Maniatty.  Implemented a multiscale framework for modeling the response of polycrystalline materials.  Developed models for capturing the incubation and nucleation stages of microstructurally small fatigue cracks in Al7075.  Contributed to the development of research proposals that were awarded \$550,000 in funding from DOD, NSF, and New York State.  Mentored students and worked closely with industrial and academic partners.

\begin{minipage}{\minipagewidth}
\textbf{Post-Doctoral Research Associate}, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Feb.~2004 - Jun.~2006) \\ 
%
Developed a crystal plasticity constitutive model and associated finite element formulation for the DARPA Structural Integrity Prognosis System project under the mentorship of Professor Antoinette Maniatty.  Modeled Al7075 using three-dimensional, explicitly discretized grain structures.  Implemented finite element software in C++ for use on large-scale parallel computers (e.g., linux clusters and IBM BlueGene supercomputers).  Programming work was done in collaboration with the Cornell Fracture Group, led by Professor Anthony Ingraffea.
