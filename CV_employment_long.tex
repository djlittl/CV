%
Led multiple projects for the development, implementation, and application of multiscale, multiphysics modeling techniques for computational solid mechanics.  Applied expertise in numerical algorithms, software development processes, and high-performance scientific computing to deliver simulation capabilities compatible with next-generation computing hardware.  Served as the Principal Investigator for ASC ATDM, ASC PEM, and LDRD projects, mentored student interns, and contributed to the broader scientific community by teaching short courses on peridynamics and serving as a reviewer for prominent journals.  Actively pursed programmatic growth through participation in multiple proposals to DOE and DoD programs.

%(1)~~Principal Investigator for the ASC-ATDM/ECP Multiscale Technology Demonstrator project.  The goal of this project is to drive development of emerging technologies for the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) and the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Advanced Technology Development and Mitigation (ATDM) program.  Key elements include the \emph{Kokkos} package for performance portability across disparate hardware architectures and the \emph{DARMA} asynchronous many-task scheduler.

%(1)~~Principal Investigator of the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project ``Strong Local-Nonlocal Coupling for Integrated Fracture Modeling.''  The goal of this project is development of a mathematically consistent formulation of local-nonlocal coupling that allows for full integration of peridynamics with classical finite element analysis.  An open-source, collaborative software framework provides a proving ground for candidate approaches. Deployment to the laboratory will occur through the \emph{Sierra/SolidMechanics} production code.

%(2)~~Serving as a lead developer for the open-source peridynamics code \emph{Peridigm}.  This work employs Sandia's \emph{Trilinos} software suite, including the \emph{Sacado} automatic-differentiation package for construction of the tangent matrix for implicit time integration.  Current applications include the modeling of ductile material failure and simulation of material fracture under blast loading conditions.

%
%(3)~~Developing a crystal plasticity constitutive model suitable for multiscale, multiphysics modeling within the \emph{Albany/LCM} simulation code.  Multiphysics modeling will capture the effect of hydrogen embrittlement.  A concurrent, Schwarz-based coupling scheme will allow the linking of an explicitly-modeled grain structure at the mesoscale with a continuum plasticity model at the component scale.
